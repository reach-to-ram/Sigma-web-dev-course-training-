titles help in seo(search engine optimization) and it is a good practise to use them
titles always change when we change a page in real time!

html tags are enerally two types 
-> self closing ones ex. <meta>, <img> etc
-> dual tags ex.<html></html>, <head></head>, <body></body> etc

meta:desc (emmet) <meta name="description" content=""> also help in seo !
-> meta discrption is the one which google shows when ever we search for any results 

<html lang="en"> 
->here lang is an atribute and en is value(key value pair)
<meta name="description" content="This page is about the seo and about video3">
->here meta is a self closing tag
->name and content are atributes
->description and This page is about the seo and about video3 are its values 

hovering on the tags or atributes gives basic informations and gives a link to mdn docs for more detailed understanding

Honorable mention from harry bhai: The difference between a junior and senior developer is that he knows from which stack overflow problem to copy and paste it here in our code and modify accordingly!
