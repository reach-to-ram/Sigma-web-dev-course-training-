CSS sizing units:
px - pixels
vw - responsive width
vh - responsive height
em - inherits from parent by default parent is 16 if 2em=2*16 
rem - inherits from root(html) same as em but from root
min height - min-height: 80vh; //responsive height 
min width - 
% - width:50%=>width will be 50% of the parent 

px pixels:
total px depends on the resolution of the device, 
as per my checking it works till 1393 pixels with border 2px
total may be 1400px as per width

for responsiveness we use view-port width and view-port height(vw and vh)
->using this irrespective of devices the width and height would be same, responsive and the code will not break

boxsizing:border box helps us to distribute the height or with b/w content,padding and border
margin:auto this makes the div evenly b/w to left and right(kind of center) but note,this only works to box level elements 

margin: 23px auto; 
=>here, 23px is top and bottom for the margin and auto is left and right

em:
inherit from parent and computes
by default font size is 16px
if we mention 1em in child then ,child font size is 16px only
if we mention 2em then it becomes 32 ie.. 2*inherited value

so if parent is 10px 
and for child it is 3em then fontsize for child becomes 30px
This is em

rem:
inherit from root and computes
ie..if root is 12px
if we mention 2rem then font size becomes 24px
