CSS Specificity and Cascade Algorithm:

there are two styles one says bg color:red and another bg color green
should bg be red or green?
ans.css specificity

<style>
        h1{
            color: aqua;
        }
       .yellow{
        color: yellow;
       } 
       .cred{
        color: red;
       }
       .cpurple{
        color:purple
       }
    </style>
here, since purple was the last declared one it will be taken into account and h1 will be colored purple
since here we are using classes, the last declared one will have the priority!
Note:even though we have element selctor used above for color aqua it is not applied because from the specificity caliculation values element selector point is 0 and class selector is 10
hence, class will get priority and in all the classes the last one will get more priority!\

Attribute selector for <h1 class="yellow cred cpurple" data-x="a">Thi is a h1 inside a div</h1>
syntax and example:
[data-x=a]{
        background-color: red;
       }



So, the order of specificity is:
Inline Style > ID Selector > Class or Attribute Selector > Element Selector > Universal Selector

Specificity Calculation:
To calculate specificity, assign a value to each part of the selector:
Universal Selector: 0
Element selectors and pseudo-elements: 1
Class selectors, attribute selectors, and pseudo-classes: 10
ID selectors: 100
Inline styles: 1000
Note:As we know classes and attributes have same specificity value 10 which ever is declared last in the style, that will be used!

!important: irrespective of specificity if !important is written beside a css property it will be applied!
this also overpowers in-line css

User agent style sheets - is the css written by the browser we can find it by inspect element

h1.yellow = speciificity is 1+10 = 11, now yellow will be applied
