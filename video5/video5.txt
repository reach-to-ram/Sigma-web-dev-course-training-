Here we talk about img tag, HTML:Tables, list tags

windows + shift + s (short cut for using builtin snippet tool to use on any website and saving them locally as screenshots)

**control + space for suggestions (for emmets, for suggestions on existing images etc)

img emmet as <img src="" alt="">
->here img is the tag
->src ie..souce and alt ie..alternative both are attributes 
-><img src="Screenshot 2024-12-26 063832.png" alt="this is a train image">
   if we add any image previously to the folder then we can use control + space to use it easily 
->here we can define height and width as attributes to the image tag but note:it is not req to use px unlike css and directly state 300, 400 etc
->alt is used when for any reason the image is not loaded and this text will be shown (good practise)

HTML Tables:(refer https://codewithharry/tutorial/html-tables) 
table tag <table></table>
tr - table row
th - table header (usually we write this only once to define all the headings of the table)
td - table data
caption - we can define caption here
br - break, gives space between lines, content, tables, lists etc
colspan attribute - <td colspan="2"></td>, this helps in combining two columns in table
rowspan attribute - <td rowspan="2"></td>, this helps in combining two rows in table
(represed these two in the index.html using css border property)

table example:
<table>
 <caption>Employee Details</caption>
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Age</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Harry</td>
    <td>100</td>
  </tr>
</table>

rowspan example:
<table>
    <caption>row span(bhanu as both dev and tester)</caption>
    <tr>
        <th>Emplyee Name</th>
        <th>Emplyee Designation</th>
        <th>Emplyee Service</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Roja</td>
        <td>Accountant</td>
        <td>3 years</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td style="border: 2px solid black;" rowspan="2">Bhanu</td>
        <td>Developer</td>
        <td>2 years</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Tester</td>
        <td>2 years</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Ramesh</td>
        <td>Accountant</td>
        <td>7 years</td>
    </tr>
</table>

Lists:
There are majorly 3 types of lists
->ul - un-ordered lists
->ol - ordered lists
->dl - definition lists

ul types:
->disc default bullet type
->square type
->circle type

ol types:
->1 default type
->I type
->i type
->A type
->a type
Note: start attribute 
ex. <ol type="1" start="3">
        <li>ram</li>
        <li>ajay</li>
        <li>lasya</li>
    </ol>
    here, type is 1 so it starts as 1.ram, 2.ajay, 3.lasya
    but as start is 3 it starts as  3.ram, 4.ajay, 5.lasya

This also works for <ol type="A" start="3">  
o/p as C.ram, D.ajay, E.lasya

Definition lists:
sample:
<h1>HTML Definition List</h1>
  <dl>
    <dt>HTML</dt>
    <dd>HyperText Markup Language: The standard language for creating web pages.</dd>

    <dt>CSS</dt>
    <dd>Cascading Style Sheets: A stylesheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in HTML.</dd>

    <dt>JavaScript</dt>
    <dd>A programming language commonly used in web development to add interactive features.</dd>
  </dl>
  
  here, dl - definition lists
        dt - definition term
        dd - definition description

These are the 3 list types
note:refer index.html for clear understanding
