The three ways to add CSS 
1.Inline CSS - not much recommended
2.Internal CSS - for smaller projected ok but not recommended for heavy production grade projects
3.External CSS - recommended for serious and production grade projects

Drawbacks of using Inline CSS:
using inline css and targeting each element takes a lot of time and also to change a h1 or a div we need to find in hundreds of lines of code and then change it, inefficient and time taking 

Drawbacks of using Internal CSS:
Here we can target an element and make changes to all the elements at once and a major drawback is the lines of css increases the html page size also increases which is not recommended!

Recommended is using External CSS

Internal CSS: by using style tag in the element itself
Internal CSS: by using style tag in the head
External CSS: by using style in external .css file and linking it to the html in head by link:CSS emmet
