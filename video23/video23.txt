CSS Display:

in html we saw div's are block level elements and span's are in-line elements\\
for div's to work like spans we can use display property!

display:inline
using this property we can change the box-level elementsto inline elements but the problem is by give display:inline all the properties that generally apply well to block level wouldn't be that good like padding, margin etc...
padding: 20px;
margin: 30px;
they apply but not propertly, for them to work normal we have to change the property to display:inline-block
//this works

display:none
visibility:hidden

display none: this makes whole div to disapper and even the space it took is disappered aswell

visibility:hidden: this makes the div disapper but the space it previously too remains the same

small intro on display:flex and display:grid
